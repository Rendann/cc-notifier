# Resume Claude Code session from push notification
#
# PURPOSE:
# This script is designed to be called from a Blink Shell URL scheme when you tap
# a push notification from cc-notifier. It automatically reconnects to your remote
# server via mosh and resumes your exact Claude Code session.
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. cc-notifier sends push notification with custom URL
# 2. You tap notification on your phone
# 3. Pushover app shows the URL link
# 4. Tapping the link opens Blink Shell via URL scheme
# 5. Blink Shell executes this script with session_id and working_dir
# 6. Script resumes your Claude Code session in tmux
# 7. You're back in your exact conversation!
#
# USAGE: mosh-cc-resume.sh <session_id> <working_directory>
#
# CUSTOMIZATION POINTS:
# - SESSION_NAME: Change to your preferred tmux session name
# - NOTIFY_WINDOW: Window number for notifications (prevents accumulation)
# - Paths: Adjust ~/bin/ and keychain paths for your system
#
# WORKAROUND for Claude Code API key issue with mosh/SSH:
# The --dangerously-skip-permissions flag bypasses permission prompts that would
# block automated session resumption. This is safe in this context because:
# - You've already granted permissions in the original session
# - The session is being resumed, not started fresh
# - You're the same authenticated user

# Ensure cleanup daemon is running (optional but recommended)
# This prevents orphaned tmux sessions from accumulating
